# WebGL Sandbox

Description: I created this repository to begin playing around with WebGL. The server is built with Express and the `/public` directory only includes `index.html` and `index.js`.

## Resources

I largely followed the [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/index.htm) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) guidlines/tutorials/docs.
